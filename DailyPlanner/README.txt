#### MevNav's In-Game Daily Planner Mod ####

Current version: 1.1.0
Last Update: May 11th, 2023
HUD overlay and Generic Mod Config Menu support added!
Please let me know if you find any bugs or have general feedback.

How to install this mod:
1) Install SMAPI.
2) Drag the folder "DailyPlanner" into Stardew Valley/Mods folder. 
3) Install Generic Mod Config Menu to change settings in-game (recommended).
4) Go into Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans and edit Checklist.txt, adding tasks you want to complete (optional).

How to create a plan: 
1) Load up your game.
2) Press [ button (left bracket) to bring up the menu. (I recommend changing this button using Generic Mod Config Menu to 'Z')
3) Click on "Add Task" tab
4) Use sliders to select when to add a daily, weekly, or one-day task.
5) Type the name of your task into the text field. 
6) Hit "Set" to add the ask. 
7) Repeat until all your tasks are added!

How to create a checklist:
1) In your Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans folder, and find the "Checklist.txt" file. 
2) If it does not exist, create it, or open the menu in-game to create one.
3) Open this file in notepad or something similar, and add a list of things you want to do, one task for each line. 
4) Save and close your file, then open your in-game menu again. 

Upcoming features:
1) Support for Mobile Phone mod
2) Support for To-Dew mod (so To-Dew and Daily Planner doesn't fight over HUD space)
2) Controller support
3) More language support (Currently only English and Spanish)
4) Ability to edit checklist in-game, although tbh I kinda like being able to just write everything in a .txt

Known issues: 
1) The text boxes on the "Add Task" tab are kind of glitchy, sometimes it's hard to de-select them. Pressing Escape and Enter de-selects them for you.
2) Really long task names can trail off the right side of the menu. A fix for that might come eventually.
3) Text in the Generic Mod Config Menu is not translated yet, this will come next patch.
