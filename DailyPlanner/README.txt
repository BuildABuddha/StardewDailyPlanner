#### MevNav's In-Game Daily Planner Mod ####

Current version: 1.1.1
Last Update: May 15th, 2023
HUD overlay now hides during cutscenes and screenshots. 
You can also now move the overlay left/right or up/down via Generic Mod Config, in case you have another mod that uses that corner of the screen.
Please let me know if you find any bugs or have general feedback.

How to install this mod:
1) Install SMAPI.
2) Drag the folder "DailyPlanner" into Stardew Valley/Mods folder. 
3) Install Generic Mod Config Menu to change settings in-game (highly recommended).
4) Boot up the game and change the keybinding for the Daily Planner menu with Generic Mod Config. 

How to create a plan: 
1) Load up your game.
2) Press [ button (left bracket) to bring up the menu. (I recommend changing this button using Generic Mod Config Menu to 'Z')
3) Click on "Add Task" tab
4) Use sliders to select when to add a daily, weekly, or one-day task.
5) Type the name of your task into the text field. 
6) Hit "Set" to add the ask. 
7) Repeat until all your tasks are added!

How to create a checklist:
1) In your Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans folder, and find the "Checklist.txt" file. 
2) If it does not exist, create it, or open the menu in-game to create one.
3) Open this file in notepad or something similar, and add a list of things you want to do, one task for each line. 
4) Save and close your file, then open your in-game menu again. 

Upcoming features:
1) Support for Mobile Phone mod
2) Support for To-Dew mod (so To-Dew and Daily Planner doesn't fight over HUD space)
2) Controller support
3) More language support (Currently only English and Spanish)
4) Ability to edit checklist in-game, although tbh I kinda like being able to just write everything in a .txt

Known issues: 
1) The text boxes on the "Add Task" tab are kind of glitchy, sometimes it's hard to de-select them. Pressing 'Esc' or 'Enter' de-selects them for you.
2) Really long task names can trail off the right side of the menu. A fix for that will come eventually.
3) Text in the Generic Mod Config Menu is not translated with i18n yet.
4) The overlay hides your floor number while you're in the mines.
