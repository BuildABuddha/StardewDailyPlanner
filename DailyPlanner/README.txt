#### MevNav's Daily Planner Mod ####

Current version: 1.2.0
Last Update: May 24th, 2023
* Several UI Overhauls. Sliders replaced with +/- buttons and "Set" buttons replaced with "Done" buttons on daily plan and checklist.
* Several overlay settings added, including moving its position and displaying checklist items. You can find them in the Mod Config menu.
* Checklist now has a way to add tasks to it in-game rather than having to edit a .txt file. You can still edit that .txt if you want to, though.
* Plans and checklist are now saved in your save game directory, which allows for unique plans for different save games.
* Minor controller support. Left thumb stick now controls your cursor in the menu. Optional controller button in Mod Config menu.
* Basic support for Mobile Phone mod. The "Daily Planner" app, for now, just boots straight into the planner menu, making it a good alternative to a hotkey.


How to install this mod:
1) Install SMAPI.
2) Drag the folder "DailyPlanner" into Stardew Valley/Mods folder. 
3) Install Generic Mod Config Menu to change settings in-game (highly recommended).
4) Boot up the game and change the keybinding for the Daily Planner menu with Generic Mod Config. 

How to create a plan: 
1) Load up your game.
2) Press [ button (left bracket) to bring up the menu. (I recommend changing this button using Generic Mod Config Menu to 'Z')
3) Click on "Add Task" tab
4) Use +/- buttons to select when to add a daily, weekly, or one-day task.
5) Type the name of your task into the text field. 
6) Click "Set" to add the task. 
7) Repeat until all your tasks are added!

How to create a checklist:
1) Load up your game.
2) Open the menu as shown above.
3) Click on "Checklist" tab.
4) Type your task into the text field at the top.
5) Click "Set" to add the task.
6) Repeat until all your task are added!

How to save/edit/back up your plans or checklist:
The files for your daily planner and checklist can be found in your Stardew Valley save folder. On Windows, this can be found at...
%appdata%\StardewValley\Saves\[save game name]\DailyPlanner
Assuming you've booted up your save game with this mod before, you will find the file 'year_1.json' and 'Checklist.txt'.
Checklist.txt is the easiest to edit yourself, feel free to type in a big long list there and save it. 
The .json files are a little harder to edit, but you can easily copy a previous year and save it as 'year_2.json' or something similar like that.

Upcoming features:
1) Support for To-Dew mod (so To-Dew and Daily Planner doesn't fight over HUD space, and perhaps even share resources)
2) Multiplayer support (I need somoene to help me test this)

Known issues: 
1) The text boxes on the "Add Task" tab are kind of glitchy, sometimes it's hard to de-select them. Pressing 'Esc' or 'Enter' de-selects them for you.
2) Really long task names can trail off the right side of the menu. A fix for that will come eventually.
3) Text in the Generic Mod Config Menu is not translated with i18n yet.
4) The overlay hides your floor number while you're in the mines.
