#### MevNav's In-Game Daily Planner Mod ####

This is the 1.0 version of this mod. The GUI is pretty much ripped out of the Cheat Menu Mod.

How to install this mod:
1) Install SMAPI.
2) Drag the folder "DailyPlanner" into Stardew Valley/Mods folder. 
3) Go into Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans and edit Checklist.txt, adding tasks you want to complete (optional).

How to create a plan: 
1) Load up your game.
2) Press [ button (left bracket) to bring up the menu. (If you want to change this button, edit Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/config.json.)
3) Click on "Add Task" tab
4) Use sliders to select when to add a daily, weekly, or one-day task.
5) Type the name of your task into the text field. 
6) Hit "Set" to add the ask. 
7) Repeat until all your tasks are added!

How to create a checklist:
1) In your Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans folder, and find the "Checklist.txt" file. 
2) If it does not exist, create it, or open the menu in-game to create one.
3) Open this file in notepad or something similar, and add a list of things you want to do, one task for each line. 
4) Save and close your file, then open your in-game menu again. 

Upcoming features:
1) Ability to edit checklist in-game, although tbh I kinda like being able to just write everything in a .txt.
2) More language support
3) Perhaps a UI icon to click on when out of the main menu? Maybe under your money counter?

Known issues: 
1) Task types under the "Remove Task" tab are not auto-translated. This'll be fixed later probably.
2) The text boxes on the "Add Task" tab are kind of glitchy, sometimes it's hard to de-select them.
